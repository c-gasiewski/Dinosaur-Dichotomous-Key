# Dinosaur-Dichotomous-Key

YouTube Link for Project: 

The main difficulty that our group faced during this project was having to learn a new language, Ren'Py. While this language incorporated aspects of Python that my group already knew, adapting our knowledge of Python to Ren'Py made this part of the project take a lot longer than expected. Although learning Ren'Py caused our group some struggles, it allowed us to experience and utilize code in a new way. Without a doubt, the most enjoyable part of this project was learning about dinosaurs. The amount of dinosaurs in the history of our world is so grand, that creating a project that helps to identify some of them was really enjoyable.
